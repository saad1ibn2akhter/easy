to be your design resource of choice by providing you with the information and 
services that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, we need to collect 
information to understand what differentiates you from each of our other unique 
users. We collect this information in a few ways. 
<BR><BR><B>Registration</B><BR>First, you may provide us with certain 
information such as your name, e-mail address, and postal addresses when 
registering for certain services such as Professional Networking, chat sessions, 
e-mail newsletters, and contests/promotions. This information is used for 
purposes such as personalization and verification. 
<BR><BR><B>Cookies<BR>
					</B>Second, we may track your visit to our site by giving 
you a "cookie" when you enter. Cookies are pieces of information that websites 
transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Autodesk 
uses cookies to make visiting our sites easier. Cookies allow us to save 
passwords and preferences for you so that you won't have to re-enter them the 
next time you visit. Cookies help us to collect anonymous click-stream data for 
tracking user trends and patterns. The use of cookies is now an industry 
standard, and you'll find them used on most major websites. Most browsers are 
initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser 
either to notify you when you've received a cookie or to refuse to accept 
cookies. You should understand that areas of certain sites will not function 
properly if you set your browser not to accept cookies. <BR><BR><B>Use of Information</B><BR>Any information you provide to Autodesk over this website is 
maintained and accessible only by Autodesk and its authorized partners. Autodesk 
uses this information to send you information such as product updates and 
special offers. Autodesk will not disclose any information about any individual 
user to entities outside of those partners except to comply with applicable law 
or valid legal process. <BR><BR><B>Sharing of Information</B><BR>The 
individually identifiable information that you provide will be used extensively 
within Autodesk to provide a personalized experience for you. Autodesk maintains 
strict controls over information you provide to us. 
<BR><BR><B>Opt-Out</B><BR>Although many of our feedback forms allow you to opt 
out (elect not to participate in certain communications) of Autodesk or partner 
communications, there are still some that do not. We are currently in the 
process of updating the remaining forms to have this capability. However, at any 
time you may request to be removed from our mailing database and we will honor 
such requests. You may send an e-mail <U>
						<SPAN style="COLOR: blue">
							<A href="mailto:webmaster@autodesk.com">webmaster@autodesk.com</A></SPAN></U> to 
our webmaster for this request. Note: If possible, please include a copy of the 
communication you received to help facilitate a timely and accurate removal. We 
welcome any questions or comments you have; please e-mail <U><SPAN style="COLOR: blue"><A href="mailto:webmaster@autodesk.com">webmaster@autodesk.com</a></SPAN></U> our webmaster. It is very 
important to us that your experience using autodesk.com is positive. We respect
