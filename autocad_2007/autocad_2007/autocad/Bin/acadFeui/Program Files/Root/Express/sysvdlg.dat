Sets the distance the dimension line extends beyond the extension line when oblique strokes are drawn instead of arrowheads.
!DIMDLI|Real|Drawing|0.3800
Controls the spacing of the dimension lines in baseline dimensions. Each dimension line is offset from the previous one by this amount, if necessary, to avoid drawing over it. Changes made with DIMDLI are not applied to existing dimensions.
!DIMDSEP|Single character|Drawing|Decimal point
Specifies a single-character decimal separator to use when creating dimensions whose unit format is decimal.\n\nWhen prompted, enter a single character at the command line. If dimension units is set to Decimal, the DIMDSEP character is used instead of the default decimal point. If DIMDSEP is set to NULL (default value, reset by entering a period), AutoCAD uses the decimal point as the dimension separator.
!DIMEXE|Real|Drawing|0.1800
Specifies how far to extend the extension line beyond the dimension line.
!DIMEXO|Real|Drawing|0.0625
Specifies how far extension lines are offset from origin points. If you point directly at the corners of an object to be dimensioned, the extension lines do not touch the object.
!DIMFIT|Integer|Drawing|3
Obsolete. Has no effect in AutoCAD 2000 except to preserve the integrity of pre-AutoCAD 2000 scripts and AutoLISP routines. In AutoCAD 2000, DIMFIT is replaced by DIMATFIT and DIMTMOVE.

Sets the total length of the extension lines starting from the dimension line toward the dimension origin. The length is set in drawing units.
!DIMFXLON|Switch|Drawing|Off
Controls whether extension lines are set to a fixed length. When DIMFXLON is on, extension lines are set to the length specified by DIMFXL.
!DIMGAP|Real|Drawing|0.0900
Sets the distance around the dimension text when the dimension line breaks to accommodate dimension text. Also sets the gap between annotation and a hook line created with the LEADER command. If you enter a negative DIMGAP value, AutoCAD places a box around the dimension text.\n\nAutoCAD also uses DIMGAP as the minimum length for pieces of the dimension line. When calculating the default position for the dimension text, it positions the text inside the extension lines only if doing so breaks the dimension lines into two segments at least as long as DIMGAP. Text placed above or below the dimension line is moved inside only if there is room for the arrowheads, dimension text, and a margin between them at least as large as DIMGAP: 2 * (DIMASZ + DIMGAP).\n\nDIMGAP also sets the gap between a tolerance symbol and its feature control frame.

Specifies the arrow type for leaders. To turn off arrowhead display, enter a single period (.). For a list of arrowheads, see DIMBLK.
!DIMLFAC|Real|Drawing|1.0000
Sets a scale factor for linear dimension measurements. All linear dimension distances, including radii, diameters, and coordinates, are multiplied by DIMLFAC before being converted to dimension text.\n\nDIMLFAC has no effect on angular dimensions, and is not applied to the values held in DIMRND, DIMTM, or DIMTP.\n\nIf you create a dimension in paper space and DIMLFAC is not set to zero, AutoCAD multiplies the distance measured by the absolute value of DIMLFAC. In model space, negative values for DIMLFAC are ignored, and the value 1.0 is used instead.\n\nAutoCAD computes a value for DIMLFAC if you try to change DIMLFAC from the Dim prompt while in paper space and you select the Viewport option.\n\nDim: dimlfac\nCurrent value <1.0000> New value (Viewport): v\nSelect viewport to set scale:\n\nAutoCAD calculates the scaling of model space to paper space and assigns the negative of this value to DIMLFAC.

!DIMLWE|Enum|Drawing|-2
Assigns lineweight to extension lines.\n\n-2\tSets the lineweight to "ByBlock."\n-3\tSets the lineweight to "ByLayer."\nOther valid values entered in millimeters include 0, 5, 9, 13, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 53, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 106, 120, 140, 158, 200, and 211.\n\nAll values must be entered in millimeters. (Multiply a value by 2.54 to convert values from inches to millimeters.)
!DIMPOST|String|Drawing|""
Specifies a text prefix or suffix (or both) to the dimension measurement. For example, to establish a suffix for millimeters, set DIMPOST to mm; a distance of 19.2 units would be displayed as 19.2 mm.\n\nIf tolerances are turned on, the suffix is applied to the tolerances as well as to the main dimension.\n\nUse <> to indicate placement of the text in relation to the dimension value. For example, enter <>mm to display a 5.0 millimeter radial dimension as "5.0mm." If you entered mm <>, the dimension would be displayed as "mm 5.0." Use the <> mechanism for angular dimensions.
!DIMRND|Real|Drawing|0.0000
Rounds all dimensioning distances to the specified value. For instance, if DIMRND is set to 0.25, all distances round to the nearest 0.25 unit. If you set DIMRND to 1.0, all distances round to the nearest integer. Note that the number of digits edited after the decimal point depends on the precision set by DIMDEC. DIMRND does not apply to angular dimensions.

!DIMSE2|Switch|Drawing|Off
Suppresses display of the second extension line.\n\nOff\tExtension line is not suppressed\nOn\tExtension line is suppressed
!DIMSHO|Switch|Drawing|On
Obsolete. Has no effect except to preserve the integrity of scripts.\n\nIn versions of AutoCAD prior to 2004 it controled the redefinition of dimension objects while dragging. Associative dimensions recompute dynamically as they are dragged. On some computers, dynamic dragging can be very slow, so, set DIMSHO to off to drag the original image instead. DIMSHO is not stored in a dimension style.
!DIMSOXD|Switch|Drawing|Off
Suppresses drawing of dimension lines outside the extension lines.\n\nOff\tDimension lines are not suppressed\nOn\tDimension lines are suppressed\n\nIf the dimension lines would be outside the extension lines and DIMTIX is on, setting DIMSOXD to on suppresses the dimension line. If DIMTIX is off, DIMSOXD has no effect.
#DIMSTYLE|String|Drawing|Standard
DIMSTYLE is both a command and a system variable. The DIMSTYLE system variable shows the current dimension style. To display the DIMSTYLE system variable, use the SETVAR command. The DIMSTYLE system variable is read-only; you cannot change its value on the command line. To change the current dimension style, use the DIMSTYLE command.

!DIMTIX|Switch|Drawing|Off
Draws text between extension lines.\n\nOff\tVaries with the type of dimension. For linear and angular dimensions, AutoCAD places text inside the extension lines if there is sufficient room. For radius and diameter dimensions that don't fit inside the circle or arc, DIMTIX has no effect and always forces the text outside the circle or arc.\nOn\tDraws dimension text between the extension lines even if AutoCAD ordinarily places it outside those lines.
!DIMTM|Real|Drawing|0.0000
Sets the minimum (or lower) tolerance limit for dimension text when DIMTOL or DIMLIM is on. AutoCAD accepts signed values for DIMTM. If DIMTOL is on and DIMTP and DIMTM are set to the same value, AutoCAD draws a tolerance value.\n\nIf DIMTM and DIMTP values differ, the upper tolerance is drawn above the lower, and a plus sign is added to the DIMTP value if it is positive.\n\nFor DIMTM, AutoCAD uses the negative of the value you enter (adding a minus sign if you specify a positive number and a plus sign if you specify a negative number).
!DIMTMOVE|Integer|Drawing|0

!DIMTSZ|Real|Drawing|0.0000
Specifies the size of oblique strokes drawn instead of arrowheads for linear, radius, and diameter dimensioning.\n\n  0\tDraws arrowheads.\n>0\tDraws oblique strokes instead of arrowheads. The size of the oblique strokes is determined by this value multiplied by the DIMSCALE value.
!DIMTVP|Real|Drawing|0.0000
Controls the vertical position of dimension text above or below the dimension line. AutoCAD uses the DIMTVP value when DIMTAD is off. The magnitude of the vertical offset of text is the product of the text height and DIMTVP. Setting DIMTVP to 1.0 is equivalent to setting DIMTAD to on. AutoCAD splits the dimension line to accommodate the text only if the absolute value of DIMTVP is less than 0.7.

!TREEDEPTH|Integer|Drawing|3020
Specifies the maximum depth, that is, the number of times the tree-structured spatial index can divide into branches.\n\n0\tSuppresses the spatial index entirely, eliminating the performance improvements it provides in working with large drawings. This setting assures that objects are always processed in database order, making it unnecessary ever to set SORTENTS.\n>0\tTurns on TREEDEPTH. An integer of up to four digits is valid. The first two digits refer to model space, and the second two digits refer to paper space.\n<0\tTreats model space objects as 2D (Z coordinates are ignored), as is always the case with paper space objects. Such a setting is appropriate for 2D drawings and makes more efficient use of memory without loss of performance.\nNOTE You cannot use TREEDEPTH transparently.
!TREEMAX|Integer|Registry|10000000
Limits memory consumption during drawing regeneration by limiting the number of nodes in the spatial index (oct-tree).\n\nBy imposing a fixed limit with TREEMAX, you can load drawings created on systems with more memory than your system and with a larger TREEDEPTH than your system can handle. These drawings, if left unchecked, have an oct-tree large enough to eventually consume more memory than is available to your computer. TREEMAX also provides a safeguard against experimentation with inappropriately high TREEDEPTH values.\n\nThe initial default for TREEMAX is 10000000 (10 million), a value high enough to effectively disable TREEMAX as a control for TREEDEPTH. The value to which you should set TREEMAX depends on your system's available RAM. You get about 15,000 oct-tree nodes per megabyte of RAM.\n\nIf you want an oct-tree to use up to, but no more than, 2 megabytes of RAM, set TREEMAX to 30000 (2 x 15,000). If AutoCAD runs out of memory allocating oct-tree nodes, restart AutoCAD, set TREEMAX to a smaller number, and try loading the drawing again.\n\nAutoCAD might occasionally run into the limit you set with TREEMAX. Follow the resulting prompt instructions. Your ability to increase TREEMAX depends on your computer's available memory.
!TRIMMODE|Integer|Registry|1

!UCSDETECT|Integer|Drawing|1
Controls whether dynamic UCS acquisition is active or not.\n\n0\tNot active\n1\tActive
!UCSFOLLOW|Integer|Drawing (viewport specific)|0
Generates a plan view whenever you change from one UCS to another. Set UCSFOLLOW separately for each viewport. If UCSFOLLOW is on for a particular viewport, AutoCAD generates a plan view in that viewport whenever you change coordinate systems. Once the new UCS has been established, you can use DVIEW, PLAN, VIEW, or VPOINT to change the view of the drawing. It will change to a plan view again the next time you change coordinate systems.\n\n0\tUCS does not affect the view\n1\tAny UCS change causes a change to the plan view of the new UCS in the current viewport\n\nThe setting of UCSFOLLOW is maintained separately for paper space and model space and can be accessed in either, but the setting is ignored while in paper space (it is always treated as if set to 0). Although you can define a non-world UCS in paper space, the view remains in plan view to the world coordinate system.
!UCSICON|Integer|Drawing (viewport specific)|3
Displays the UCS icon for the current viewport using bitcode. UCSICON is both a command and a system variable. It is the sum of the following:\n\n0\tNo icon displayed\n1\tOn; icon is displayed\n2\tOrigin; if icon is displayed, the icon floats to the UCS origin if possible\n3\tOn and displayed at origin.\n\nThe UCSICON command controls the visibility and placement of the UCS icon. Because entering ucsicon at the Command prompt invokes the UCSICON command, you must use the SETVAR command to access the UCSICON system variable.
#UCSNAME|String|Drawing (viewport specific)|
Stores the name of the current coordinate system for the current viewport in the current space. Returns a null string if the current UCS is unnamed.
#UCSORG|3D point|Drawing (viewport specific)|
