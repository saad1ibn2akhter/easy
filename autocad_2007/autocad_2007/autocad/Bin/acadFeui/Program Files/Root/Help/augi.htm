  <B>Autodesk User Group International (AUGI)</B><BR>
  AUGI is a worldwide organization that represents users of Autodesk products. Its mission is simple, but powerful.

Through this free exchange of knowledge, AUGI members grow, not only as individuals, but also as team members for their companies and the industries they serve. With a host of educational programs, training and networking events, and peer-to-peer interaction via online discussion forums, AUGI is a catalyst for more productive end users in all walks of professional life.

  <B>AUGI Country Chapters</B><BR>
  AUGI consists of a network of country chapters, each fronted by a website, which helps AUGI members residing in those countries to increase their professional education and share knowledge and ideas with other members in their native language or with other AUGI members worldwide. Other country chapter website features include country-specific and worldwide content such as articles, white papers, and other information, information on active local user groups in the country; and access to many educational offerings.

  <B>AUGI Local Chapters</B><BR>
  Within each country chapter are any number of local chapters, often referred to as LUGs (local user groups). Joining a local chapter gives Autodesk product users a chance to meet face to face at regular meetings. Local chapters, usually oriented toward a specific industry, take learning down to the local level, and, with sponsors that include resellers and other trusted advisors, active involvement in a local chapter can provide a wealth of education and networking opportunities that simply aren't attainable by any other means. To find a local chapter in your area, or to learn how you can establish a local chapter, simply visit <A HREF="http://www.augi.com">www.augi.com</A>.
